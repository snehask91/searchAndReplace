Assignment details:

Create a module that exports a function named "searchAndReplace".

The function has to process a nested JSON object and replace the old domain to new domain.

For example,
"https://cdn.localhost.dev/dev/202006/9ada1f665d99-1592130713518.png";
becomes
"https://cdn.bookmyshow.com/dev/202006/9ada1f665d99-1592130713518.png";

A new object with the replaced values is returned by the function. At the same time, we also want a list of the original urls being transformed.
